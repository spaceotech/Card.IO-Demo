# Card.IO-Demo

As you might already know that the idea behind Card.io is to make the experience of paying smoother and easier by allowing users to directly scanning their credit cards using camera, instead of typing credit card information manually. And with Card.io integration in your Android app, you can add this functionality for your Android app users.

Here, we’ve a created a demo on [How to Integrate Card.io to Create Credit Card Scanner App For Android](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/integrate-card-io-create-credit-card-scanner-app-android/). 

If you want to implement this feature in your Android app and looking to Hire [Android App Development Company](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-app-development/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
